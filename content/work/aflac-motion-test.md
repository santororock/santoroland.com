A quick motion test we made back in the day for Aflac. The reasoning behind the test have been lost to the sands of time.
But it was a fun use of Maya's PaintFX.

Feel like this was probably a pitch for director David Kelly. He was always looking for fun and new ways to make lines in 3D space for his motion graphic commercials. Mostly he worked alone. But on some rare occasions I had the opportunity and pleasure of working with DK. He was after all the motions graphics KING of nyc!

This test probably took an afternoon. I used to lament and wonder what would happen if we could spend several days or a couple of weeks on a motion test. Likely something amazing!

Curious had the opportunity to create this set of three lovely shots for the pilot episode of Nurse Jackie. We spent a a full day on set shooting macro highspeed film, but went with the CG in the end. Anton Tokar rigged up the simulation, and I was once again VFX sup. I got to shade, light, render and composite though:) I do love to get my hands dirty!

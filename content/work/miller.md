I wish I had the final version of the commercial with the picture drawing battle animated on. Sadly only the shot I worked on made it into the archive.

Funny little spot the studio whipped up in a jiffy.

Total production time concept to broadcast was less than 24hours! Ian Hutchinson was the lead compositor. I really like this spot. It marks the first time I used '''flexwarp''' in a production. A milestone for Curious Pictures. Look how that glass is now filled! what's that? 40min to air? I got that!

This spot was also unusual as it the timing was so tight, that we broadcast straight from the studio to live TV during the Emmy's. Everything was crazy exciting back then.

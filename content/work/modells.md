Marci Ichimura and I tag teamed comp supervising these Modell's spots. At Curious Pictures that meant setting up the pipeline for the show, ingesting and conforming all the media, being responsible for the 2D production and all the client deliverables.

Marci completed all the aspects of that baseball shot which I thought was super cool. She modelled, shaded, lit, rendered, matchmoved, and composited the final shot! Talented lady.

For myself, I took on the less glamorous shots of sky replacements and placing Modell's logos on the BG bleachers.

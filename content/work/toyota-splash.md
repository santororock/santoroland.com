This Toyota commercial marks the first and last time I freelanced:)

Connie Conrad was working at Imaginary Forces and they needed some help painting out imperfections on the truck macro shots. Most of the paint work was being done in Combustion at the time. Connie and I stuck to After Effects though.

Ed Manning was the visual effect supervisor and demanded that all communication be handled through email. There were only like 5 people in a small room working on the spot, and the rebel Connie Conrad refused because it was ridiculous, and her insubordination was and endless source of amusement to me on the long cold days.

I had fun though on the commercial. It was a new space. I loved seeing how another studio besides Curious Pictures worked! I felt like a spy, even though, I was not working for anyone.

Who's the bozo looking at camera in the first shot? Seriously. Is he union?

Melissa Johnson produced. I was playing VFX sup and Lead Compositor. I think this marked the first gig the studio let me out unattended. In fact, the circumstance was so completely unceremonious my boyfriend was confused when I wanted to celebrate being trusted with anything at all:)

It's the little victories that are super awesome sometimes!

To shoot this commercial we rented out the NYC Subway Museum. That was pretty cool.

The boys and I were all jonesing to do some character animation. Then our creative Dominie Mahl sneaks up one day with this insanely cute reindeer for a Christmas card! Well all spent a few days and nights cranking Lars(that's his name) out for some holiday cheer. Steve Muniz modelled and rigged, Josh Greer animated, Dominie directed, and I shaded, lit rendered, and comped the little angle. Who doesn't love them some non-photorealistic rendering?!?

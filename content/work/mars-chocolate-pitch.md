This is a pitch that I (and likely have the staff comp team) worked on for director [David Griffiths](http://www.griffdp.com/index.html) at Curious Pictures. I can't recall if he did a lot of table top / high speed work, but he seemed really keen to pitch this spot. Working with David was really fun. He is this surly Australian....or he's from New Zealand....shame on me for not remembering! But, honestly, salt of the earth this guy.

Mainly I recall painting out tons of little bubbles and extra bits of exploding chocolate that competed with the feel of the piece. I'd been playing pipeline for a while by this point, and welcomed putting my headphones on and concentrating on work with a clear goal!

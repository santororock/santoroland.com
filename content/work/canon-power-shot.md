This job holds a special place in my heart. I was working at Curious Pictures on Little Spirit at the time. The producer of canon asked me to pick up a hard drive with media from Digital Kitchen on my way to work the next day. Next thing I know I'm given a computer, a log in, and am leading the HD compositing effort over at DK! Spent the next three days working at another studio. Guess it's only strange because I was very much staff at Curious Pictures at the time.

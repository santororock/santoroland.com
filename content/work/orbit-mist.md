There was a time when I tried to convert every full CG project we produced at Curious Pictures into stereoscopic 3D. At one point I even bought some 3D hardware and made a stereoscopic presentation to the partners of the company who looked at my blankly and responded: "How does this make money?". Which I did not, and still do not have an answer.

Unfortunately I did not complete the conversion of this shot. Freelance artists feeling different pressures than staffers would often 'break the rules', and do things like working locally, or not utilize the render farm. So I was never able to find the time to search and find all the materials to complete this conversion.

BUT. This clip is one of the few I managed to keep for my personal archive. Stereoscopy continues to be a passion of mine.

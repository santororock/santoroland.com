I didn't contribute a whole lot to this spot. Mostly I worked out the toon shader in maya for the team. Also I got to model the 747 airplane! I have a vauge memory of cleaning up some of the cad files we recieved for the train stations.

I was so excited to be a part of a team which was making a commercial which would play on TV all around NYC. It was so exciting. It was hard to believe that some one with no accidemic training could get to work in a real studio!

Lewis Kofsky was VFX & CG sup. The actors had hard lighting on set which looked insane until we got them into the animated world.

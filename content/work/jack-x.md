A quick pitch we created for director Leopoldo Gout. The animation is based on the book: Dangerous Days of Daniel X., a crazy alien kid stranded on earth.
We were given a matte painting and were told to make it move....but make it look EXACTLY like the drawing. I thought it turned out pretty nice. Ben 10 came out that summer on Nickelodeon, and this little guy couldn't compete.

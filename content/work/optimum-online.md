This spot holds a special place in my heart. I can't exactly recall my role in the production. I vaugely remember being on set, but also think that either [Marci Ichimura](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3252314) or [Cory Alderman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cory-alderman-bb01b75/) were playing VFX sup and comp supervisors. Likely I was just playing 'technical lead', setting up the pipeline, ingesting material and checking deliverables.....2011 was a very very busy year.

All that being said. I LOVED this spot. The lyrics were so catchy. It was impossible to not tap your feet and dance a bit. I might have even made it my ring tone or After Effects render que completion tone to troll those two for a year or so afterwards. Good times!

Also I loved working with puppeteers. I think they are some of the greatest people on the planet. Completely insane and wonderful:) Performers and story tellers. Incredibly talented people who's passion is contagious.

Some projects complete straight away, or don't have enough time to even do that.

This little gem though. He lingered.

This commercial was fun as I recall, over the course of several months every compositor in the studio worked on it in some fashion. The agency would return with a small animation timing changes, or would desire more butterflies. Etc.

I worked on the two whale shots. But, was neither the last or the first to do so:)

We transformed this ordinary hockey rink footage into a beautiful ice-capades for Morgan Spurlock's television special on the Simpsons. All the work was done in After Effects. Tom Lynch, Lisa Hung, Cory Alderman, Annie Moore and I all worked on the transform. All the lighting tracking and compositing was done in AE! No 3D matchmoves! Since the lighting on the rink was pretty loose we were able to handtrack the camera's in AE. Crazy ghetto workflow, but we worked SUPER fast and did the effect for pennies:) There is a breakdown at the end. We had alot of fun creating these shots!! Note the number of lens flares!! Enjoy!

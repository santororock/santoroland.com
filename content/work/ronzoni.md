These two spots for Ronzoni were fun. Steve Oakes directed. I got to fly out to LA to play VFX Sup. Super pro crews out there. From budget to compositing I got to be really involved in this one. Don't think I worked on a job that's laid off to a tape since then. Oh digibeta. Who will remember you?

Steve Oaks the director was always creating interesting behind the scenes videos when the shows wrapped up. You can sort of feel the generation gap he was catering to in this one. As a director he played well to his audience:)

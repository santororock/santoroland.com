I was playing VFX sup and lead compositor on this spot. The whole thing was shot on our stage in NYC at Curious Pictures. Then we onlined all the footage at got to work.

I liked the idea of this commercial. It was simple. "Slow motion stuff happening against live action stuff." Straight to the point. Clear. Executable. From start to finish this spot took about 3 weeks. Two of those in comp, with 4 people including myself. I'm pretty sure Tom Lynch, Tara Jacobson, and Jesephine Nor were the artists work on that spot with me:)

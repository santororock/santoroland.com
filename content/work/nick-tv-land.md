Directed by Nobel Jones, and VFX supervised by Lewis Kofsky. This was an epic VFX job. So many cool rigs to remove, greenscreens, matchmoving, set extensions. You name it we used it.

This was my second BIG job at Curious Pictures on staff. I was playing lead compositor. So I had to run the editorial, conform, ingest, 2D workflow, and output again to the clients. It was my second time in this role at the studio, but it was still intimidating!

I learned how to matchmove on this one. ha. You could write a small book of the things I didn't know before this gig. Kyle McColloch and I made breakdowns of all the shots we worked on. SD was crazy. Let's never go back to that!

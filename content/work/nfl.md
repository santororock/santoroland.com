I composited the cheerleader shot:)

Mostly I was playing comp sup on this commercial. At this point in the studio, I started looking expanding our comp leadership pool, as there were more productions going on at any one time than I could manage. Jesse Mireaux stepped up to the plate on this commercial. I ran backup, making sure all the deadlines, pipeline and production design was there, and Jess handled the conform, compositing and delivery. It is a pleasure to work with people who are so competent and trust worthy!

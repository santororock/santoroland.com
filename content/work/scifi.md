Scifi - pitch

I think this actually aired at some festival....though it might have only been a pitch. Abe Spears directed a small series of these over a few months. Perhaps 7 of these little spots were produced...?

The two spots here were the only ones I got to touch one intense afternoon. I thought the ideas were so cool! It was a pity that SciFi didn't want to air them.

The tentacles were modelled, rigged, animated, lit, and rendered by Anton Tokar. Pretty talented guy huh?!

I played compositor on these spots.

This is the intro the Johnathan Ames' show Bored To Death. Tom Barham directed. Was charged against me to devise the process of animating characters 'made out of words'. I spent a few weeks building the sweetest animation rigs in AE for creating, simulating, handling the thousands of text layers which made up each character. It was a complete blast. Marci Ichimura and Mark Rubo wound up doing a greater part of the heavy lifting. I love a job when the whole team jives really well!

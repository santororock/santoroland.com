Like most of the projects for Morgan Spurlock, this one was shrouded in mystery. Jeremie Chilnik came to us with a brief and a deadline for a title card the Warrior Poets needed for....presumably everything. But in this instance, it was a film they had in a festival.

In total we spent several days on this. I always wished we had more time. With just several more days I could have created fluid simulations for the blood splattering and improved the transition/fade during the camera.

Being a working artist, means sometimes, one must put the pencil down when the test is over, and try to find peace in the work you had time to do!

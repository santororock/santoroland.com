I didn't make an impactful contribution to this job overall. Several months after the spot completed I think the clients came back with some major editorial changes. I recall spending some days retimming all the photos in the aftereffects projects the freelancers had left behind.

Mostly, I remember wanting to take on this task because Haley Morris, Curious Picture's fabulously talented director created the spot. She was young for a director, but had the rare gifts of both working well with others, and communication. So I wanted to see how that worked first hand.

Oh 3D Studio Max, my first love. While still very very green as a young intern, Lewis Kofsky asked me to create a CG animation test of a city for Mo William's show Sheep in the Big City that Curious was producing at the time. This was probably the 3rd thing I ever made in 3D....and it went on TV!!! Hahahaha. I believe this was the start of the long list of things I would come to not understand. It was like winning the lottery. I was soooo excited. My grandma made a cake and we had a small party that weekend.

I wish the world love and cake:)

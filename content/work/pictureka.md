Sometime you work on big projects that take months of planning, money, and people to pull off.
Other times you are asked to do things like this Pictureka end card.
I had no idea how this was being used. Never saw the spot. Unusually, I didn't even know this commercial was happening until I was asked to comp the little guy jumping off the package. Took a few hours. I was patted on the back and told I did a good job. The whole scenario was so strange, I decided to keep it for the memory.

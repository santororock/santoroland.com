GLAD

This was a pitch we did for Glad Trashbags. Steve Oaks directed. Done in an afternoon, and pretty rough.

But, every once in a while you work on something that just tickles you. It can't be helped. I loved the way James Godwin animated the trash bag. The whole proof-of-concept spot is just so darned cute! I was playing TD and compositor of course.

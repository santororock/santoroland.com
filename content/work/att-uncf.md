Played VFX sup and Lead Compositor on this ATT spot. Devil of a rig removal and stabilization on this high-speed time-remapped dolly shot. Few. Only pity is that I never got to make an awesome breakdown of how we did it. This job was a team effort if there ever was one. Josefine Nor & Marci Ichimura were on 3D Detail, while Jodie Rae Plaut, Stefania Galico and I were on comp and rig removal. That's a bunch of folks working on one shot!

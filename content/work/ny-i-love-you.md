Scarlett Johansson in her directorial debut created this film with Kevin Bacon for the compilation of shorts in "NY I LOVE YOU". It was asked of me to colorize the last shot of Mr.Bacon sitting on Coney Island Pier. It was January. That was a cold shoot!! Copied my memory of the color of the video tap on set. Turned out pretty cool. The clients pushed the color to the extreme of course:) The film was eventually cut from the compilation because it was not it color. Sadness.

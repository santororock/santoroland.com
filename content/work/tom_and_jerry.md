Tom and Jerry was an interesting film to work on! 2D Animation in live a live action feature. It had been years since working on a project like this. Framestore had the entirty of the charecter work with London leading and Montreal taking the backseat so to speak. London had the lion's share of the work, and Montreal a little less. The split was 60/40 I think. London's development and marketing team had spent nearly 2 years before production started wooing the clients with motion tests and style tests....etc. So, by the time Montreal joined the team in October 2019, the film was well into production with few unknowns.

The largest challenge with any 2D style animated feature for the artists is often continuity for the charectors and style. It litterally takes a small army of artists to model, rig, animate, render, and assemble the images for the big screen. Each person bringing thier past expierences and experties to the specific piece of the puzzle they are charged to complete.

In the case of animation this means keeping the chars "on model".... When Tom or Jerry is looking straight at the camera, thier eyes need to be in a specific position and scale matching the charector model sheet. This is because, unlike more detailed photorealistic CG, 2D animation has very little 'information' for our brains to grab onto. One could go so far to say that 'rendering animation with the smallest amount of information possible' (lines) is a difining charisteristic of the medium. Less lines to draw = more time to focus on movement and story. So, any small variation in line position results in the charectors note 'feeling' like themselves. This is the animation supervisor's work to maintain this 'model' continuity.

In modern animation times like now, the animators work in 2D software like Toon Boom and would be charged with keep track of color and 'fx' passes of the 2D work. But for Tom and Jerry, since it was rendered in 3D using the new Framestore Freak renderer, it was the lighting and compositing team who was in charge of color continuity and finishing. This was work of the London and Montreal 2D supervisors. We had to build a system where the lighters were free to 'work like normal' but also maintain the specific colors of the chars in changing lighting conditions.

Frederikke Glick spent many weeks assembling the workflows for the charector model sheets converting each to rec709 and P3 varients to that every artist (lighting and comp) could have an automatic button or burnin which would overlay the shot's chars into a reference layer that the 2D, CG and VFX supervisors could check in dailies for continuity. It was an impressive suit of tools they built!

These char references were burned into most internal submissions for the first round of client notes, approvals and temps. Once a 'look' for a sequence was esablished we slowed phased the reference burnins out of production and could work towards finaling shots the regular way. Sequence leads would do a first pass at maintaining continuity based on client approved hero shots. VFX sups would approve shots. Finally 2D sups would sweep up for a last continity check before the shots left the studio.

The last piece of the puzzle for Tom and Jerry, and arguably the most important....was that in Jan 2020, the whole studio was sent to work from home because of the Sars Covid pandemic. This was a huge wrench in the gears for any production. How we handled this as a studio, and specifically as a film production team is something I'm really proud of. 

On Tom and Jerry we made the contravesial decision to prioritize the wellbeing of our employies and team members over the requirments for delivery. The studio worked with the clients to reduce our capacity to 80% and extend the delivery by the same amount. In this way we were able to create production designs which all but eliminated overtime, and required us to many very few creative comprimises. This was a lot of work for the management teams, but I'm glad came together as studio to try our best to relieve the stress of VFX work for the time of the pandemic.

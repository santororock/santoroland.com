Tom and Jerry was an interesting film to work on! 2D Animation in live a live action feature. It had been years since working on a project like this. Framestore had the entirety of the character work with London leading and Montreal taking the backseat so to speak. The London studio had the lion's share of the work. The split was 60/40 I think. London's development and marketing team had spent nearly 2 years before production started wooing the clients with motion tests and style guides....etc. So, by the time Montreal joined the team in October 2019, the film was well into production with few creative unknowns.

The largest challenge with any 2D style animated feature for the artists is often continuity of characters and style shot to shot. It takes a small army of artists to model, rig, animate (draw), render, and assemble the images for the big screen. Each person bringing their past experiences and expertise to the specific piece of the puzzle they are charged to complete. So workflows and procedures are created so artists can compare their work against target imagery. Lots of meetings and reference materials:)

In the case of animation this means keeping the chars "on model".... When Tom or Jerry is looking straight at the camera, their eyes need to be in a specific position and scale matching the character model sheet. This is because, unlike more detailed photo-realistic CG, 2D animation has very little 'information' for our brains to grab onto. One could go so far to say that 'rendering 2D animation with the smallest amount of information possible (lines)' is a defining characteristic of the medium. Less lines to draw: more time to focus on movement and story. So, any small variation in line position results in the characters not 'feeling' like themselves. This is part of the animation supervisor's work, to maintain character 'model' continuity across the show.

In modern animation times like now, animators often work in 2D software like ToonBoom and would be charged with keep track of 'color' and 'fx' passes of the 2D work. By contrast, Tom and Jerry was rendered in 3D using the new Framestore Freak renderer. Because of this, it was the lighting and compositing team who were in charge of color continuity and finishing. This was work of the London and Montreal CG & 2D supervisors. We had to build a system where the lighters were free to 'work like normal' but also maintain the specific colors of the chars in changing lighting conditions and scenes.

[Frederikke Glick](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4366607/) (my partner in crime) spent many weeks assembling the workflows for the character model sheets converting each to rec709 and P3 varients to that every artist (lighting and comp) could have an automatic button or burn-in which would overlay the shot's chars into a reference layer that the 2D, CG and VFX supervisors could check in dailies for continuity. It was an impressive suit of tools they built! In the past when I worked in telivision and childrens animation we would have also included CYMK and Pantone values on the Character Model Sheets. But this clients was happy to let the marketing team handle those details.

The char model sheet references were subsequently burned into most internal framestore submissions. Also for the first round of client notes, approvals and temps. Once a 'look' for a sequence was established we slowed phased the reference burn-ins out of production imagery and worked towards finaling shots the regular way. 2D Sequence leads would do a first pass at maintaining continuity based on client approved hero shots. VFX sups would approve hero shots. Finally 2D sups would sweep up for a last continuity check before the shots left the studio for delivery.

The last piece of the puzzle for Tom and Jerry, and arguably the most important....was that in Jan 2020, the whole studio was sent to work from home because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was a huge wrench in the gears for any production. How we handled this as a studio, and specifically as a film production team is something I'm really proud of. 

On Tom and Jerry we made the controversial decision to prioritize the well being of our employees and team members over the requirements for delivery. The studio worked with the clients to reduce our capacity to 80% and extend the delivery by the same amount. In this way we were able to create production designs which all but eliminated overtime, and required very few creative compromises. This was a lot of work for the management/production teams to schedule, but I'm glad we came together as studio to try our best to relieve the stress of VFX work for the time of the pandemic.

Hotel Exterior sequence, again mostly Spike, but with Tom and Jerry mixed in. Interesting set extensions for the NYC streets with mixed DMP & Footage with tracking cameras cars and crowds. The images are seamless, and if I didn't know how much work they put into these shots I would be hard pressed to believe it!

- Character: Tom
- Character: Jerry
- Digital Set Extensions
- Multi Plate Stitching

Jerry's Suite Sequence
-----------------------
Compositing Supervisor: [Anthony Luigi Santoro](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2182150/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)

Sequence Lead: [Jorge Sanchez Fresno](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6601869/)

The Jerry Suite sequence of shots was part of the 'Full CG' sequence that we created which had one off shots in many sequences in the film cross sites. This is the largest collection of these shots which tell the story of Jerry's new home. A fully CG build. Loads of work went into it as it initially played a larger role in the film. I was happy it still had enough shots in the final cut to make sense and appreciate the environment build:)

- Character: Jerry

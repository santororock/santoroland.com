I had been wanting to make a ZoomQuilt for ages and ages since seeing the original: [link](http://zoomquilt.org/)

In 2008 we landed a gig with Dentyne to produce a zoomquilt for their South American brand (I believe). The spot was a web showcase only....on a commercial website...so the flash application existed live for a few short weeks only. Which was a real shame because I thought this spot turned out great. John Almand was the amazing illustrator. We hired two artists to ink and paint. The whole project took 6-7 people about 4 months to complete.

I'm a big fan on lens flares, shine and glow.

When this job came to the studio they sent it to me to work on. Happy days!! The idea was that the basket ball players were being formed out of 'energy and light' when the shoe boxes opened. We actually never strayed from the very first style frames I painted. They loved it! Haha! Lisa Hung, Cory Alderman, Josephine Nor, and I glowed the crap out of those plates. My personal count was 24 lensflares by the end of it!!! Booaahahahaha!

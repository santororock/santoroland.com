Matt Smithson directed this spot for charter communications. There was a small team of animators....and I wound up having to give up some of the compositing work because of the deadline. The end shot they wanted the characters to 'peel' off the wall and look around the corner. That was all Anthony! Got to stretch my 3D fingers a bit again. Nothing complicated. Just a nice composite and an adorable spot!

We created these series of spots for Comedy Central during their 'Comedy is Dangerous' campange.

Kennan Moran directed the spots. I got to play VFX sup and lead compositor. Ian Hutchenson worked on this with me that summer. For some reason we had loads of time to complete the spots. They turned out nice so it was worth the effort!

We created 7 spots in total. Two were inducted into MOMA as part of their commercial archive or something.... I have no idea how they display them honestly:) Felt like a big honor at the time and the studio was very very happy about it. This was an awesome job!

Also, we got the spots and breakdowns in the Siggraph Animation Festival that year!

Even though this is super old, I still think this is a pretty spot.

Molly Shwartz was the Lead Compositor on this gig. This was my second commercial as staff at Curious Pictures. Since Molly was doing all the heavy lifting, I was free to mess around and stretch my wings a bit.

On this spot I playing 3D maya modelling texturing and rendering. Only small things like the ground, trees etc. I was still very green.

This is the job that Molly taught me about expressions! Turned out that After Effects had scripting abilities like Maya! I expressioned up all the twinkling lights and delivered to Molly what I thought were really cool comps at the time:) After Effects had shown me it's secrete, and I gave it my heart!

After winning the Emmy for the title sequence on Bored to Death, our director Tom Barham was approached to make many title designs.
This was a pitch he and I made for the opening of a new show Unforgettable. The series was going to follow a crime fighting detective who had perfect memory.

Tom painted a photoshop still and drew some illustrations of what he wanted, and I put the whole thing in motion using After Effects. Since I had the experience of converting a number of projects to stereo 3D by this point, it was a fairly painless process to draw a depth map of the actress's photo and dimensionalize her to create the orbiting effect.

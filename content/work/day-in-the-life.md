I had no idea what was going on with this spot. I knew that the producer was our buddy Jeremy Chilnick....but I never learned the show.....or how this title was used.

Word of advice. When summoned to produce animation of a Split Flap display.....do a little rnd first! Haha. I thought I was going to be able to rig this thing up in AE in just a few hours. 4 days of fairly intense Maya Rigging later, I had a toy that we could predictably animate and art direct!!! I'm going to use that rig for EVERYTHING now:) haha. Damned Split Flap display. How you shamed me.

Even as a fully grown adult I find it difficult to write blurbs about myself. I'm sure there are loads of interesting and fun reasons why that is. But for the sake of this website and putting things out there, I stole this one from [FMX](https://fmx.de/) and the Framestore marketing team who were kind enough to write me a little bio. Modified it a bit, see if you can spot the differences;)

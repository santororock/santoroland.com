Since meeting some adventurous peoples in university who hiked the Appalachian Trail, I'd been inspired to take the trip myself. There seemed something majestic about spending months in the woods. While, other mechanisms of travel I'd tried before were fun and exciting (air and motorcycle), there was something appealing about not having to worry about hotel room bookings, rental cars, or where I might eat at any given moment.

Mostly though, I suspected that I simply loved being outside, in the woods.

In 2014 the opportunity finally presented itself for the following year. I booked 6 months away from my job as a 'sabbatical'. Spent months and months planning. Then, hit the trail in July 2015. Keeping a journal, I converted the memories to a blog for friends and family who were interested in the trip. Hope you enjoy the ride. The posts feel honest, and the pictures are worth a thousand words!


Follow the link for the trail blog. It tends to be a bit intimate. But it's honest:)

That's it! Hope you enjoyed the adventure as much as I did. It was tough. It was unexpected. But, I'm glad I had the time to work through the expectations vs reality, and manage to 'hike my own hike' in the end. Some lessons from the backpacking, I will take with me through out my life time. The pace. The speed of problem solving. It was so different from the fast world of the entertainment industry.
